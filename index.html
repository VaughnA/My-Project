		<strong><p>Challenge 0:</p></strong>

		<p>This circuit is working because it has a complete flow of electricity. It is traveling from the power cable, through the light, through the resistor, and finally to the ground cable, which completes it.</p>
		<center><img src="Working.jpg"/></center>
		<p>This circuit works for the same reason as the last, it's a complete circuit. The set up is just different.</p>
		<center><img src="Noflow.jpg"/></center>
		<p>This circuit isn't working because the leads on the light bulb are switched, as the negative side is on the positive side of the board and the positive side is on the positve. Therefore the electricity doesn't flow correctly through the light bulb and it doesn't work.</p>
		<center><img src="Notcomplete.jpg"/></center>
		<p>This circuit isn't complete as you can see that the light bulb isn't on the same row as the ground cable, which makes it not a complete circuit.</p>
		<strong><center><p>Challenge 1:</p></center></strong>
		<center><img src="Gif1.gif"/></center>
		<strong><center><p>Code:</p></center></strong>
		<center><img src="challenge1.PNG"/></center>
		<p>For this challenge we had to program our lights to say something in morse code. My partner and I made our light say "swiggty" (Inside Joke) using Python and a breadboard.</p>
		<strong><center><p>Challenge 2:</p></center></strong>
		<center><img src="gif2.gif"/></center>
		<strong><center><p>Code:</p></center></strong>
		<center><img src="challenge2.PNG"/></center>
		<p> For this challenge we had to program our lights to do a pattern using "For" loop to create the pattern. In addition, we had to program a user input to start the lights, in our case we used the "A" to start the light show. In other words we had to program our lights to start only when the user presses a specific button to start it.</p>
		<strong><center><p>Challenge 3:</p></center></strong>
		<center><img src="challenge3.gif"/></center>
		<strong><center><p>Code:</p></center></strong>
		<center><img src="challege3.PNG"/></center>
		<p>For our final challenge we had to program our lights to match the beat of a song. My partner and I chose the song "YMCA" by The Village People. In addition, we had to load and play a song through the GoPiGo, which could only be heard through the audio jack. After trial and error my partner and I finally got the song and the lights to work at the same time. </p>
