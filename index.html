		<p>This circuit is working because it has a complete flow of electricity. It is traveling from the power cable, through the light, through the resistor, and finally to the ground cable, which completes it.</p>

		<p>This circuit works for the same reason as the last, it's a complete circuit. The set up is just different.</p>

		<p>This circuit isn't working because the leads on the light bulb are switched, as the negative side is on the positive side of the board and the positive side is on the positve. Therefore the electricity doesn't flow correctly through the light bulb and it doesn't work.</p>

		<p>This circuit isn't complete as you can see that the light bulb isn't on the same row as the ground cable, which makes it not a complete circuit.</p>
